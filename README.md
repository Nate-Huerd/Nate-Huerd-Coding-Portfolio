# Nate Huerd's Coding Portfolio

This repository is currently an in-progress build of my coding portfolio. As more content is finished, this repository will be updated.

The first linked project that you will find is run-buddy, which was completed during the first two modules of the coding bootcamp. This project had us start from a mock-up of what the Run Buddy company wanted their website to look like. Through HTML and CSS, we were able to create a website that looked, operated, and responded to user input as requested.

There are more projects in the works. To get an update on what I am currently working on, please email me at nhuerd3@gmail.com.
